# Predicting Sine Wave Using RNN

Generating and predicting the future for Sine wave using Recurrent Neural Networks.

Firstly I generated a sine wave using Numpy. Later I train the network on existing waves and predicted the future possible wave which I added to my exiting Sine wave. 
I have also used "Long Short Term Memory".
